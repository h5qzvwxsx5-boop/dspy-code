# Natural Language Commands

DSPy Code supports **natural language for all commands**! You don't need to remember slash commands - just describe what you want to do.

## 🎯 How It Works

Instead of typing `/connect ollama llama3.1:8b`, you can simply say:

```
connect to ollama llama3.1:8b
```

DSPy Code automatically understands your intent and routes it to the appropriate command.

## 💡 Tips

1. **Be natural** - Just describe what you want to do
2. **Include details** - Mention filenames, model names, etc.
3. **Mix and match** - You can still use slash commands if you prefer
4. **Both work** - Natural language and slash commands work together

## 🔄 How It Works Internally

DSPy Code uses a **hybrid intelligent routing system**:

### Step 1: Fast Pattern Matching (First Attempt)
- Matches your natural language against known patterns
- Fast and deterministic
- Handles common cases instantly

### Step 2: LLM Reasoning (Intelligent Fallback)
- If pattern matching fails, uses your connected LLM (Ollama, OpenAI, etc.)
- Understands context, variations, and intent
- Handles edge cases and natural language variations
- Uses conversation history and current state

### Step 3: Argument Extraction
- Automatically extracts parameters (filenames, model names, etc.)
- Works with both pattern matching and LLM reasoning

### Step 4: Command Execution
- Routes to the appropriate slash command handler
- Executes the command with extracted arguments

### Example Flow

```
User: "I want to use the llama model that's running locally"
  ↓
Pattern Matching: ✗ No match
  ↓
LLM Reasoning: "User wants to connect to Ollama model"
  ↓
Extract: provider="ollama", model="llama3.1:8b" (from context)
  ↓
Route to: /connect ollama llama3.1:8b
  ↓
Execute command
```

### Benefits

- **Fast** - Common commands are instant (pattern matching)
- **Intelligent** - Handles any natural language variation (LLM reasoning)
- **Context-Aware** - Understands conversation history and current state
- **Flexible** - Works even with unusual phrasings

**You can use natural language for everything, or mix it with slash commands - whatever feels more natural to you!** 🚀
